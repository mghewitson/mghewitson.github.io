## Description

_This is my web development portfolio page. This is a page where I will let the world know what I've built with programming. I utilized HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in order to style it. Please view the site in any browser at <http://mghewitson.github.io> _

## Support and contact details

_If you have any issues with the site or notice any bugs, please contact me at:_

## Technologies Used

_Bootstrap was crucial in the building of this site. The section of the page that I struggled the most with was creating a responsive button in the navbar, that when a small screen is viewing the page a three-tiered 'hamburger' link would be the main navigation. I went rogue and used hyphen's as a placeholder, and I'm actually feeling ok about the look anyway._
